# omegle_bot

# Install

npm install

# Start Server

npm start

# Notes

- Captcha works however it requires your server to be omegle.com
- Editing your hosts file to use omegle.com:3001 will fix that
- Manually accepting the captcha on the real site and then using this app can be used as a workaround
